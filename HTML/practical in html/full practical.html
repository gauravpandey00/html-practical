        I will not explain you more about me but i want to say something about myself. I was born in a village of
        farrukhabad on 9 august ,2003. I was intrested in study from my childhood i completed my 5th from my village's
        primary school and after that i get admission in class 6th in Bhartiya padhsala inter college in farrukhabad. I
        was happy to get admission because i was only the boy who was going to studying in farrukhabad that time my
        village was not developed much that's why few people could send their children in a big college and i was lucky.
        But after getting i had a big problem, that how would i go to my school because my home was too much far from my
        school but after some time i decided to go to school by train and this was to much difficult to do in my 10
        years old age but i did it. But, after 2 years i was wasting my a lot of time in train that's why i decided to
        leave that school but that school was nice .
        And i got admission in jay singh inter college of Nawabganj and this school was also nice and teachers was also
        good here i completed my 12th with a dignity i am really happy to studying in that school . Now i am parsuaning
        my BCA frm oxford group of institution and this also a nice institute and in current time i am in 3rd semester
        of BCA.
        And i am also teaching to some students for personal expensives and this gives me peace in my life really i want
        to say onething when you bring your all expensive by yourself then this is the very nice thing to your parents
        because we get self dependent and also we get a conffidence to do something by ourself.
        forget about it,
